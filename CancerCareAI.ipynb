        "\n",
        "\n",
        "* `semantic_search`: Uses Sentence Transformers to find passages that are semantically similar to the query. We use the \"all-MiniLM-L6-v2\" model, which is a good balance of speed and accuracy. You can explore other models.\n",
        "\n",
        "* `rerank_with_crossencoder`: This uses a CrossEncoder, which is more accurate than the Bi-Encoder used in semantic_search, but slower. It takes the query and each passage as a pair and directly predicts a relevance score. We use \"cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2\", a model trained on the MS MARCO passage ranking dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "* `combined_retrieval`: This is the core of the retrieval pipeline. It combines the results of BM25, semantic search, and cross-encoder reranking:\n",
        "    * It first runs BM25 and semantic search.\n",
        "    * It takes the top N results from each of these methods and combines them into a single list (removing duplicates).\n",
        "    * It then reranks this combined list using the CrossEncoder. This is more efficient than running the CrossEncoder on all passages.\n",
        "    * Finally, it normalizes the scores from each method (to a 0-1 range) and combines them using weighted averaging. This allows you to tune the importance of each component.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Normalization: Scores from different models aren't directly comparable. Normalization brings them to a common scale (0 to 1). The formula used is a standard min-max normalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Weighted Combination: The bm25_weight, semantic_weight, and crossencoder_weight allow you to control the influence of each ranking method. You'll likely need to experiment with these weights to find the best combination for your data.\n",
